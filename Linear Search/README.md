## Problem Statement
Implement Linear search on a List using Array in C.

    i)  Insertion at the specific position.

    ii) Deletion at the specific position.

## Linear Search
Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.

## How Does Linear Search Algorithm Work?
In Linear Search Algorithm, 

- Every element is considered as a potential match for the key and checked for the same.
* If any element is found equal to the key, the search is successful and the index of that element is returned.
+ If no element is found equal to the key, the search yields “No match found”.
