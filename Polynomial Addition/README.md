## Problem Statement :
Write a program for polynomial addition.

## Polynomial Addition :
Given two polynomials represented by two arrays, write a function that adds given 2 polynomials. 

    Input:  A[] = {5, 0, 10, 6} 
            B[] = {1, 2, 4} 
    Output: sum[] = {6, 2, 14, 6}

    The first input array represents "5 + 0x^1 + 10x^2 + 6x^3"
    The second array represents "1 + 2x^1 + 4x^2" 
    And Output is "6 + 2x^1 + 14x^2 + 6x^3"
