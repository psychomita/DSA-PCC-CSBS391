## Problem Statement :
Write a program in C to implement a menu driven stack application.

## Stack :
A stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion of a new element and removal of an existing element takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

To implement the stack, it is required to maintain the pointer to the top of the stack, which is the last element to be inserted because we can access the elements only on the top of the stack.

## Basic Operations on Stack
In order to make manipulations in a stack, there are certain operations provided to us.

    push() to insert an element into the stack
    pop() to remove an element from the stack
    top() Returns the top element of the stack.
    isEmpty() returns true if stack is empty else false.
    size() returns the size of stack.
