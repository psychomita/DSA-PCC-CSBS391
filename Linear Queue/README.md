## Problem Statement :
Write a menu driven c program to implement linear queue using array.

## Queue :
    A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed 
    in First In First Out (FIFO) order. 
    
    We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from 
    the list are made at the other end.  The element which is first pushed into the order, the operation is first 
    performed on that.

### Characteristics of Queue:
+ Queue can handle multiple data.
+ We can access both ends.
+ They are fast and flexible. 

### Queue Representation:
Like stacks, Queues can also be represented in an array: In this representation, the Queue is implemented using the array. Variables used in this case are

+ Queue: the name of the array storing queue elements.
+ Front: the index where the first element is stored in the array representing the queue.
+ Rear: the index where the last element is stored in an array representing the queue.
